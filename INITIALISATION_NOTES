# 24/01/2017
# To run use: bash INITIALISATION_NOTES
# The scripts needed are in the /root directory

# Expected environment:
## You should have mounted the DataVolumes directory outside the contained (option --volume in Docker) so that the data remain persistent. 
# The volume is empty. 

# 1. Initialise the database use:
/root/initDatabase

# This will create the directory structure inside /DataVolumes. 
# This is needed for postgres to run

# 2. Start the Postgresql daemon with:
/root/startPostgres &
# This will send the database process into the background.
echo "Waiting for Postgresql daemon to launch"
echo "Try to initialize SQL configuration files"
sleep 20
# 3. Load the Postgis libraries and scripts. 
# 3.bis Create a superuser biospytial and the database biospytial with password biospytial.
# Note: Run it as postgres user
sudo -u postgres /root/initPostgis
